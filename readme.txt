Hi Dear, 
My name is Renato and I am a website development student based in Australia - Brisbane.
Please, feel free to download this project and execute it on localhost. 
The necessary mysql database you will find in the mysql-database folder.

This project is part of my portfolio while I have been studying and learning.
I am looking for job opportunities and I hope this project helps me to show some of my skills and knowledge.

ps: images are included in the view/images folder, if you want to insert a new book with book cover, 
it is necessary to place your book cover image in the images folder and also insert the cover image path in the form input value.

The objective of this project was design a book library application for admin users and staff.
- Library is accessed using the admin/staff USERNAME or PASSWORD.
- Only admin has the right to add a new user with the specific 'role' -> admin.
- Staff can not add new user, but can add book, delete book, edit book and send enquiries to admin user.

Username: admin
password: 123456

Username: staff
password: 123456

This project was based on CRUD functions create, delete, update, read and Model-View-Controller (MVC).
- I have included some font-awesome icones which you will  only be able to see if there is internet connection.
- Media query was used to display none and/or display block some contents on mobile view.

Security:
* All pages have been assigned with SESSION variable login which you can only see them if logged in.

* The password is encrypted and stored.

* Input values are sanitised before insert and all input values binded.
I understand there more ways to protect the database from injection, but this project was just a prototype focused on functionality.

Thank you.

Renato Silva.
